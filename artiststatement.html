              <p>To me, being an artist is being myself. I knew from a young age that I wanted to be an artist, and if you look back at all the little elementary worksheets asking what my future career will be, nine out of ten times it will say “artist”. I am a creative person and the one thing I’m always confident in is my art and ideas, and as I grew older I continued to find myself surrounded by other creatives in creative spaces. I always felt the most comfortable in an art class with peers who have unique ideas and perspectives to share, and I felt like I belonged, and to this day I still feel that way. At the beginning of high school, I began to let myself feel the only path to success was through a non-art major, however, I never felt it was right, and it took me nearly four years to realize that. When I thought of myself in any field unrelated to art, I did not feel that same intense excitement and hope I felt when I imagined myself in a creative career where I could express myself and/or help bring others' ideas and messages to life. I knew at that moment that being an artist is my purpose in life, and denying myself the chance to pursue that would be a mistake.
                Being an artist is about expressing myself and creating visual messages about personal and social issues. It is about having fun and creating beautiful things, or releasing bottled-up emotions and opinions on the current state of the world, or even personal issues. Art is an essential part of everyone’s life even if they don’t realize it, and it makes me happy to know I will contribute to this world in such a unique way. I am someone who finds it challenging to express my emotions and opinions verbally at times, and art has always been an outlet and a form of communication and expression for me, for both negative and positive experiences. It always brings me so much joy to see people cherish art and see how it elevates so much of life experiences. Everyone has something that makes them feel alive and purposeful and being an artist will always do that for me. It brings me so much joy when I see the positive impact art leaves on people, and the messages spread through it. 
             I have come to realize I want to be a part of the digital art world and find ways to be an activist and an artist, that will reach a larger audience. Art has been how I get my message across to people, and as we begin to advance technologically, I have begun to explore digital mediums, and fallen in love with creating digital works. I want to dedicate my life to creating digitally and finding ways to grow as an artist, to me this is what my purpose in life and as an artist is.
